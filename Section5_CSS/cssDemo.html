			h1 {
				color: purple;
			}
			li {
				color: orange;
			}
			The last definition for the selector will be chosen for application as can be seen here
			.There is a h1 styling above which makes h1 tags purple, but since h1 was declared below
			once more, hence that styling will overwrite the previous and h1 tags will be blue in color
			h1{
				color: blue;
			}
