_we also work on higher order functions usages and JS scopes via different examples_

_The Section11_JSArrays contains_array examples and methods exposed by arrays such as length push pop shift unshift indexOf and slice_
_We also work with for loops and forEach with arrays. In the last part we discuss forEach and how it works and also create custom_
_forEach implementation and add it to Array.prototype_

_The Section12_JSObjects contains difference between Array and Object syntax and object basics. We also see how we can add methods_
_to objects and discuss the this keyword_

_The Section13_DOM_Manipulation contains dom manipulation methods which are commonly used, important DOM properties_
_and different element selector methods and the multiple ways we can use them. We also introduce style DOM property to set CSS._

_The Section14_DOM_Events explains how we add DOM listeners to HTML elements and also how we can attach multiple listeners to a single HTML element_
_And also we see how parent listeners can be activated by child events. We also see more about the mouseover and mouseout events and how to use it_
_in conjunction with click events in todo.html_

_The Section15_RGB Color Game has been done as a separate github project and will not be found in this project_

_The Section16_jQuery has tutorials on how to effectively use jQuery for day to day development purpose. We learn_
_how to use jQuery library locally and over CDN and what is the difference between minified and normal version_
_manipulating css using jquery with id class and element selectors_

_The Section17_jQueryEvents demonstrates click() keypress() and on() methods_

_The Section18_toDoList In this we created a todo list application with javascript html css and jquery_

_The Section19 consists of creating a patatap clone -> https://patatap.com/_

_The Exercise2_Div_Span_Demo contains the solution of the Image and Anchor tag_

_The Exercise3_Tables contains the solution of the Tables module in which we build a Pokemon table to understand tables better_

_The Exercise4_Forms contains the solution of the Forms module in which we use form and various inputs and validations to build a dummy form which can be submitted_

and after that we write some problem sets for for loops_

_The Exercise11_JSArrays contains example usages of push pop shift unshift indexOf slice and accessing indices of an array_
_also we code along on how to create a To Do list using arrays and also modify the To Do list in another session to incorporate functions
and the usage of foreach. Lastly we do an array problem set (isUniform, printReverse, max and sumArray)_

_The Exercise12_JSObjects contains object exercises on object basics taught in Section12_JSObjects_
_and also we build a movieDB to demonstrate the object basics learnt_

_The Exercise13_DOM_Manipulation contains different ways to select a particular DOM element using the dom selector methods discussed_
_in Section13_DOM_Manipulation_

_The Exercise14_DOM_Manipulation contains a color changer application which makes use of DOM events learnt so far. We also make a score keeper app
using the same concepts. The original app made by the author is also available_

_The Exercise15_RGBColor Game has been done as a part of RGBColorGame in my github repository. Please check that project_
